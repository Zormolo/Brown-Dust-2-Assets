## Assets Extractor
The extractor is made by Aelurum. Version 1.2.3 of the CLI is used.

## Known Stuff i need to Fix!
Bright Moon Dalvi, Sword Queen Slyvia, Gamer Club Rafina, Kind Liberator Samay are cursed if you open then now -> Reason extracted PNG has diff Size then in the atlas file expected, if you want to open then just resize them to the size writen in the atlas file
I will do a check later that fixed those sizing issues

Cursed Celia has a weird ID in the charater spine folder -> her ofical id is based of the "new" cutscene 060401 i will fix that later too
B-Rank Manager Gray has in every file a .skel. i will remove tht later too
B-Rank Helene Skill Cutscene used cutscene_Char instead of cutscene_char
Those error need a fix in name of the file and changing the .atlas file for that costume if you want to make on your own in the mean time

UI -> costume_icon
There are few files that dont follow the default naming pattern like icon_costumeXXXXXX its just icon_costumeXXX i will append the missing numbers later too


## Issues
If you find any other weird file naming or fils that doesnt macht the default pattern of that section pls open an issue
The same goes for stuff you like to have included in the repo

I will ofc add more stuff
but what is there atm is the most import for most ppl
I will also add the audio files when i have a good CLI client to extract them from the bank-files
